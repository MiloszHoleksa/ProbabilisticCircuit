This repo contains code for a Mixed Probabilistic Circuit - Convolutional NN architecture. The network was trained on the MNIST dataset. We performed some experiments, comparing the Mixed architecture to baseline models. More info in the paper.
Abstract:

 This study investigates a hybrid architecture combining Con
volutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Probabilistic Cir
cuits (PCs) to enhance performance on image classification
 tasks. CNNs are effective at extracting spatial features from
 images, capturing patterns from edges to complex textures
 through hierarchical filters. PCs, in contrast, are probabilistic
 models capable of exact inference and robust handling of un
certainty and missing data. The architecture leverages a CNN
 for feature extraction, transforming image data into structured
 representations for PCs, which model probabilistic dependen
cies to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
 Results show improved classification accuracy and robustness
 to incomplete data compared to baseline PC model, demon
strating the potential of combining CNNs and PCs for tasks
 requiring interpretability and uncertainty handling.
